The assignment 2 is to implement 52 methods in Enumerable.rb
I implement those methods by using each method and external iterator since some fundenmantal methods are not offered and I need to define them by myself.
I put my implementions in test2.rb and import them in class TestTriple. To test the methods I wrote, I change the original method into my own method in test.rb, the test examples are as before.
And all the examples are passed. It can imply that my methods are right to some extent.
